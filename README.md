# FCA_Big_Homework
In this work I analysed three DataSets (Heart Disease,Cars,Bank Subscription) with classical Machine Learning methods (RandomForest, Logistic Regression, KNN)  <br />
Also, I do an FCA classification of these DataSets. <br />
Finally, I make a resume of efficiency of these approaches.
